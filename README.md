A Local business finder app

## Getting Started

The BisFind app is an application that help users find local businesses around then. it was built using the flutter framework of the dart programming language.
It's main purpose is to find Local businesses aroud it's users location to prevent the user from going a longer distance when there are local shops around which offer same services.
The application also increases the daily sales of local businesses in the sence that people don't have to travel far distances to get merchandise or get services which are available aroung them.

# Technologies used

The flutter framework of the dart programming language was used to build this project. The map locations were gotten from the flutter map package and flutter map marker cluster package that is why ckusters of markers are 
seen on the screen and when a distance in latitude and longitude are not very far from each other, it groups them together using numbers. No Database technologies were used.
The application is not yet fully functional as tha map package do not point to actual stores but they point to actual locations using latitude and longitude. There are still some features which have not yet been implemented such as efficient statemanagement in the authentication and all other unimplemented features will be implemented.
